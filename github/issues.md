# Talking to Myself: GitHub Issues as Notes

Any time I have a thought that'll entail some amount of consideration and effort, I file it as a new issue on the repository for a project, and collect the state of my thoughts in comments.

This makes it so, if I go off from the project and *return* to it *later*, I have all my notes on how I wanted to proceed spelled out, with every contradiction and turn displayed as further comments in chronological order, in sliced and tagged fashion through labels on the issue. It also allows *other* users to jump in by @mentioning them or anything like that.

It's really a fantastic way to develop (writing out sloppy thoughts in prose before winnowing them down into something sensible for code), and I heartily recommend it.
