# how-i-roll

Articles on how I do that voodoo that I do so well.

This is sort of a supplement / complement / side-project to my [Lean Notes](http://www.leannotes.com/), where I've collected *thoughts* on *aspects* of doing various things, but no real cohesive *narrative* (and a bit of a phobia for leaving out the personal/compromising/gritty/fleeting details required for such a narrative, like the way I've been cloning repos using GitHub for Windows on my gaming PC to draw projects' logos, rather than figuring out how to do it right without leaving the browser the way I do for the actual *coding*).

Lean Notes feeds into this, and with luck, what I write in this repo can feed back into Lean Notes (my "proper" project, ie. Lean Notes has its own org while this repo doesn't).
