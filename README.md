# how-i-start

Articles on how I do that voodoo that I do so well.

This is sort of a supplement / complement / side-project to my [Lean Notes](http://www.leannotes.com/), where I've collected *thoughts* on *aspects* of doing various things, but no real cohesive *narrative* (and a bit of a phobia for leaving out the personal, gritty, fleeting details required for such a narrative, like that I've been cloning repos using GitHub for Windows on my gaming PC to draw projects' logos).

Lean Notes feeds into this, and with luck, what I write in this repo can feed back into Lean Notes (my "proper" project, ie. Lean Notes has its own org while this repo doesn't).
