# Writing

People have been telling me for years "you should have a blog". It makes sense - I've got a lot to say. That said, blogs haven't really stuck to me.

I don't really like any existing blogging solution. Existing platforms are either too imposing or not opinionated enough. Beyond just the pure software-implementation problem, the whole notion of "a blog" is too restrictive to fit my model of what I do. Even "multiple blogs" doesn't fit.

Traditional "blog" content is like:

- E/N posts that mean everything to the author but nothing to anybody else. If I'm going to write something, I'm going to write it with an idea in mind of why somebody would want to read it, and "because they have some kind of weird obsession with me apropos of nothing else" is not a healthy reason. (Besides, [I have Twitter for that](https://twitter.com/stuartpb).)
- Stuff that restates an existing topic the author has written about before. I don't feel like wasting my time writing filler so someone else can waste time reading it. I'd rather just revisit the thing I'd already written and edit that to fix the omission. I'm not really the "write several distinct posts in arbitrary order and never revist them" type. I'm more of a "wiki" guy.
  - I actually did experiment with having a MediaWiki circa 2010, but that fell apart, as fragile PHP instances without a diverse tooling and access ecosystem are wont to do. Also, the content had serious scope-creep, with lots of stubs as I jumped around trying to nail breadth-first content for a site that was ostensibly designed to grow into a Wikipedia-like community project, rather than focusing on it like a personal work.

So, after a long while of pretty much keeping this sort of thing bottled up, the space I've sort of drifted into where I'm starting to get stuff done is creating repos on GitHub for the things I'd write about, on the order of one repo per "topic". In theory, each repo is like a book, or a wiki, or something like that: a discrete cyclopedia that can be edited and expanded to incorporate all the content I wish to convey within its scope.

Examples (this will probably get explanded into its own proper index page at some point, in some form, somewhere, somehow):

- [CouchDB in a Hurry][]
- [Waxhead Revisited][]
- [specs-laws][]
- [github-best-practices][]
- [Primer Prime][]
- [Understanding Lua][]
- [western-civilization-walkthrough][]

(You'll have to go to their individual repos for the summaries, I'm not rewriting those right now)

The last four examples were touch-and-go experiments that predated me *really embracing* this GitHub-repo-full-of-Markdown-files-written-like-rough-drafts-without-any-real-regard-for-making-it-look-nice-Gonzo-Hemingway-purple-monkey-dishwasher-this-is-a-stream-of-consciousness-and-I'm-okay-with-that paradigm, which is why they don't really have any content. (Some of those were also more-or-less attempts at using GitBook that didn't really take off because of too much up-front friction around getting the format right.)

It's not like I invented the idea, I was inspired by some specific repos that took similar approaches where they existed primarily to hold the README (a paradigm that had already been embraced by services like GitBook):

- https://github.com/nolanlawson/state-of-binary-data-in-the-browser
- https://github.com/k88hudson/git-flight-rules

Basically, I've come down in favor of writing *too much* stuff, because when I was trying to right *the right amount* of stuff, it ended up being *too little* stuff - in most cases, no stuff at all. (What ended up becoming Lean Notes was originally a collection of Markdown files in another project I hadn't made the first commit on because I hadn't "figured out" how I wanted to "integrate" them.) It's easier to fix the former than the latter.

On the subject of not being constrained to a format, there are other similar projects I've done, falling somewhere on the "content" spectrum that some people would reserve for blog posts, that don't *quite* match the "book" paradigm I described above, but share a similar path to success in that I did them because the only "format" I was adhering to was the "raw materials" ahead of any architectural/ontological concerns:

- [Lean Notes][] (not even on GitHub because I can't even figure out how I'd do it as "files" yet)
- [safari-is-the-new-ie.com][]
- [s4-specs][] (not articles)
- [chatroom-of-requirement][] (actually made using AirPair's whole article thing because I was trying to participate in their writing competition)
- [pop-sankey][]
- [doodles-and-riffs][]
- [w5-graph][]
- [date-rosetta][]
- [stuart-explains-the-internet][] (text work toward a video series that I ended up improvising)

I could add more, but it's really veering into that aforementioned "needs its own index" territory.

In short, I don't need a blog: **My GitHub account _is_ my blog**. (Not to be confused with https://stuartpb.github.io/ which is really just where I did some stuff back when I did odds and ends and before I fully embraced granular repositories.)
